# CodeBattle2.0
Team Lo-Ki Winners

# Guidelines
1. Add classes corresponding to database tables in models.py
2. Add HTML views in templates folder
3. Add background images used, CSS style files in static folder
4. Once database is created, export it in .db file and add that file in app folder with name "CodeBattle.db".
5. Use variable, function and route names passed as parameters between views and controller as mentioned in skeleton only to avoid confusion.
